Sub-Saharan Africa carries the highest burden with an estimated 71\% of the global total. In Ethiopia, an estimated 715\,404 people were living with HIV in 2015 and this increased to 722\,248 in 2017. This study was to explore the trends and spatial distributions of HIV cases in Ethiopia.},

  abstract = {Many resource-limited countries are scaling up antiretroviral treatment (ART) towards universal access. However, there are few studies which evaluated outcomes of ART programs in these countries. In addition, these studies generally include a limited number of facilities and patients creating a clear need for studies with a wide range of facilities and large numbers of patients. In this study, we intended to evaluate the outcomes of the ART services in 55 health facilities in Ethiopia.},
